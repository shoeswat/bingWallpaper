bingPaper
=====================

These scripts take bing photo of the day, modifies it, and posts it as your background. You can see an example of what the desktop looks like at: http://yoshimondal.blogspot.com/2013/01/bing-wallpaper-changer.html

This works specifically for me, but you can modify it for your needs. I've tried to comment the code enough so people can see what I'm doing and what needs to be changed.

I spent alot of time trying to get this working with cron. If you're running ubuntu 12.04 make sure you've installed the most recent updates (as of Jan 7th, 2013). This will save you a lot of heartache -- gsetting is whacky on the 12.04 base release.

Also big-ups to all the developers I stole code from!
